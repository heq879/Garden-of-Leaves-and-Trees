            Here we sit by the bench, 
            and watch the kids in the playground.

            Unsheld the curtain, ,light reflecting off the water, a forest of clear leaves.

            What day is it?
            Is it nothing but a fraction of time, leaking through the gaps in the leaves?
            <br>
            <br>
            I walked pass the street, two sit on the stairs. It was cigarette and coffee, and the smell of wet green.

            Time newly born, yet falls like snow piling on pine trees, drip and drop, bit by bit, sounds of winter chimes.
            <br>
            <br>
            When it snowed in the pine forest, it snowed in my room too, once. But they were chopped down, shattered, gone, and my room was too.

            A river laid in her body, now growing into the ulcers of memories that poured down.

            <br>
            What poured down together was time,she eroded like rag, shrunken from years of use.
